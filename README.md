# Facial-Expression-Classification-Using-Residual-Neural-Nets

Here we bulid a deep neural network to detect facial expressions in images. We performed the following steps:

    • Import libraries/datasets and perform preliminary data processing
    • Perform Image visualization 
    • Perform image Augmentation, normalization and splitting
    • Build Deep Residual Neural Networks 
    • Assess/evaluate trained model performance
